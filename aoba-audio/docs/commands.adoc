= Aoba audio engine

This document explains the commands which can be used by the IPC.

== Sending commands

To send a new command, the Port 0 has to be modified. Whenever a new value is
sent on Port 0, the lower 6 bits of the value are being interpreted as a command.

To send a command twice, you can alter the 6th bit of the command freely, because
it is not used for any purpose than this.

Command byte format:

|===
| Bits | Description

| `0-cccccc` | The command ID to invoke
| `1-------` | Streaming commands
| `-b------` | Can be altered freely to force a change in this byte
|===

== Commands

This list explains all commands the APU supports:

If the SNES is requested to send `??`, you can send any value except the previous
one. It is preferred to send positive values. The APU will mimic the value if it
sends back a `??`.

Ports declared as `--` can have any value stored.

=== 01: Reset

The *RESET* command allows to reset the state of the APU to a safe state without
any playback, stream or samples loaded.

| > SNES | `01` | `--` | `--` | `--` | Send RESET command
| < APU | `01` | `--` | `--` | `--` | ACK

=== 02: Send sample

Allows to upload a new sample to the audio engine. The data upload is only
proceed if the sample is not yet uploaded.

[cols="1,1,1,1,1,100%"]

| Sender | P0 | P1 | P2 | P3 | Description

| > SNES | `02` | `id` | `--` | `--` | Send the *id* of the SAMPLE requested to upload
| < APU | `02` | `nn` | `oo` | `oo` | *nn* is negative, if this sample is new,
                                      otherwise it will mimic the *id* value.
                                      *oooo* represents the target offset in the
                                      APU RAM where the sample will be stored. The
                                      *oooo* value is only sent if *nn* is positive.

6+| if *nn* is positive, the command ends here, otherwise continue:

                                       in the APU RAM (starts at `$6000`). *vv* is
                                       the sample volume.
| < APU | `??` | `--` | `--` | `--` | ACK

| > SNES | `??` | `aa` | `pp` | `pp` | *pppp* is the default pitch value for the sample.
                                       *aa* is the low byte of the samples ADSR
| < APU | `??` | `--` | `--` | `--` | ACK

                                       divided by three. *aa* is the high byte of the samples ADSR
| < APU | `??` | `--` | `--` | `--` | ACK

6+| repeat the following commands until all data has been transmitted
