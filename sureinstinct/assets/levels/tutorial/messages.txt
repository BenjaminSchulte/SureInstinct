#1
Welcome to Sure Instinct!

Try to get yourself familiar with the controls.
You can control the ball with the mouse
or the directional buttons on your controller.

#2
Well done!

Can you see the goal below?
Your objective in this stage is to reach the goal.

You can collect gems on your
way to increase your score.

#3
By rolling onto this striped area below
you can change the perspective from
the top to the bottom of the level.

It's the same level, just from below! Give it a try!

#4
Levels can look very different
from the bottom side.

You might need to keep a
good orientation in some stages.

#5
Be careful at some places!

Do not roll into this acid or any lasers.
If you lose all of your energy
you have to restart the stage.

#6
This door still seems to be locked,
but maybe it can be opened from
the other perspective of the map.

Also, be careful with fragile floors,
as they will break the same way on both sides. 

#7
Looks like you just found some keys.
Do you remember a place with a blue door?

#8
You can collect money to buy items.

Try to buy this parachute.

#9
If you fall into an abyss you will lose a life.

Fortunately, you just got to buy a parachute:
Should you fall into the abyss, hold down
\"B\" or the left mouse button to save yourself.

Feel free to try it out, it's just the tutorial level. 

#10
If you're out of money you can still steal items
by rolling onto the item and wait for a short time.

However...
Stealing items will cost you some energy.

#11
This item here is a "bridge".

Select it by using \"Y\" or the right mouse button
until you see it bottom, left of the screen.

Hold the \"B\" button or the left mouse button while
rolling onto an abyss to build a bridge.
